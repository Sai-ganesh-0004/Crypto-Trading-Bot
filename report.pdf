BINANCE FUTURES ORDER BOT – DEMO / TESTNET
PROJECT REPORT

1. INTRODUCTION

This project implements a command-line based trading bot using Python for Binance USDT-M Futures Demo (Testnet).
The objective of the project is to demonstrate practical usage of the Binance Futures API, including order placement,
input validation, logging, and secure API credential handling.

The bot interacts with Binance Futures Demo environment, ensuring that no real money is used during testing.
This project was developed as part of a hiring assignment to evaluate backend development, API integration,
and problem-solving skills.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The system is designed as a modular CLI application.

Core components:
- Python scripts for different order types
- Binance Futures API for order execution
- Environment variables for secure API key management
- Logging mechanism for tracking actions and errors

Each order type is implemented in a separate Python file, making the code reusable and easy to extend.
The bot communicates directly with Binance Futures Demo servers using the official python-binance library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

3. BINANCE FUTURES DEMO (TESTNET)

The project uses Binance Futures Demo (Testnet), which provides simulated trading with virtual funds.

Key characteristics:
- No real money involved
- Demo USDT balance (approximately 10,000 USDT)
- Real-time market prices
- Same trading rules as live futures trading

A demo API key was created using the “Demo Trading API” option available on the Binance Futures Testnet website.

4. IMPLEMENTED ORDER TYPES

4.1 MARKET ORDERS

Market orders are executed immediately at the best available market price.

Command used:
python src/market_orders.py BTCUSDT BUY 0.002

The bot validates inputs and sends a MARKET order request to the Binance Futures API.
All order responses are logged for traceability.

4.2 LIMIT ORDERS

Limit orders are placed at a specified price and remain open until the price condition is met.

Command used:
python src/limit_orders.py BTCUSDT SELL 0.002 95000

The bot checks the minimum notional requirement before placing the order.
If the order value is below 100 USDT, the request is rejected with a clear error message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

5. INPUT VALIDATION

Before placing any order, the bot performs validation checks:
- Symbol format validation
- Quantity and price conversion to numeric values
- Minimum notional value check (100 USDT as per Binance Futures rules)

This prevents unnecessary API failures and ensures compliance with exchange rules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

6. LOGGING AND ERROR HANDLING

All API requests, responses, and errors are logged in a structured log file named bot.log.

The logging system records:
- Order placement details
- API responses
- Error messages and exceptions

This helps in debugging, monitoring, and auditing bot behavior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

7. SECURITY AND API KEY MANAGEMENT

API credentials are stored securely using environment variables.
A .env file is used to store the API key and secret, which is excluded from version control using .gitignore.

This approach prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials when uploading the project to GitHub.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

8. DEMONSTRATION AND RESULTS

The bot was successfully tested on Binance Futures Demo environment.
Market and Limit orders were placed and verified through:
- Terminal output
- Binance Futures Demo UI
- bot.log entries

Screenshots of successful order placement, open positions, and log entries are included as evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

9. CONCLUSION

This project successfully demonstrates:
- Integration with Binance Futures API
- CLI-based trading automation
- Secure credential handling
- Logging and validation best practices

The bot can be further extended to support advanced order types such as OCO, TWAP, and Grid strategies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

10. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Possible enhancements include:
- Web-based or GUI interface
- Advanced order strategies
- Risk management features
- WebSocket-based real-time market data handling
